# Shopping

When users are shopping online, not all will end up purchasing something. Most visitors to an online shopping website, in fact, likely don’t end up going through with a purchase during that web browsing session. It might be useful, though, for a shopping website to be able to predict whether a user intends to make a purchase or not: perhaps displaying different content to the user, like showing the user a discount offer if the website believes the user isn’t planning to complete the purchase. 

Simple script to measure the accuracy of nearest-neighbor classifier to solve this problem. Classifier trained with 12000 records from a shopping website.
